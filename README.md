# Playing here...

This is my attempt to keep semi-current with some languages while
learning others, in this case my playing with the HackerRank 30
Tutorial (beginner java), but in this case implementing the challenges
in

+ Java
+ JavaScript
+ Python
+ Clojure
+ C++

The directories are numbered by the challenge. There should be a
readme, and potentially a script file of some sort to run, or compile
and run the code.

30 Days of Code is an opportunity for you to learn how to code or
brush up on your fundamentals. Each day, youâ€™ll unlock a new challenge
and a corresponding video tutorial to help you learn.

The tutorial is Java-based, but you can also choose other popular
languages to submit your solution. Topics include if-else statements,
recursion, data structures and more.
